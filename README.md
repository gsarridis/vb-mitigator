# Visual Bias Mitigator (VB-Mitigator)


The Visual Bias Mitigator is an open-source framework designed to empower researchers in the field of bias mitigation in deep learning, particularly within computer vision tasks. This codebase provides a comprehensive environment where users can easily implement, run, and evaluate existing visual bias mitigation methods.

With the increasing awareness of bias in AI systems, it is crucial for researchers to have access to robust tools that facilitate the exploration and development of mitigation techniques. The Visual Bias Mitigator (VB-Mitigator) serves this purpose by offering:

- ðŸš€ **Implemented Methods**: A collection of established visual bias mitigation techniques that can be directly utilized, allowing researchers to replicate and understand their functionality.
- ðŸ”§ **Extensibility**: Researxhers can exploit this code-base to develop custom bias mitigation approaches tailored to their specific needs. The framework is designed with flexibility in mind, enabling easy integration of new approaches.
- ðŸ“Š **Performance Comparison**: The framework facilitates the performance performance between custom methods against state-of-the-art approaches. 

The aim of this repository is to facilitate research on the domain of visual bias mitigation in deep learning. By providing a comprehensive codebase that allows researchers to easily implement and build upon existing methodologies, we encourage the development of new approaches for addressing biases in computer vision tasks.
